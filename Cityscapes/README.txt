The Cityscapes Dataset
The Cityscapes dataset [5] contains　5,000　images,including 2,975 images in training set, 500　images in validation set and 1,525 images in test set. The images in this dataset are collected in street scenes from 50　different cities, with high quality pixel-level annotations of　19 semantic classes and high resolution of 2048×1024. Intersection over Union (IoU) averaged over all the categoriesis adopted for evaluation.
